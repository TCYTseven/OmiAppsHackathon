        {
            "front": "What is the main goal of transcription in DNA replication?",
            "back": "The main goal of transcription is to create an RNA copy of a single strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule, also known as the template strand. This process involves reading the genetic information from the DNA molecule and using it to synthesize a complementary RNA molecule."
        },
        {
            "front": "What is the purpose of using Design Challenge thinking in robot development?",
            "back": "The purpose of using Design Challenge thinking is to identify problems and subproblems that need to be solved by the robot, allowing for a structured approach to addressing its limitations and improving overall performance."

            "front": "What are the basic components of RNA similar to in terms of chemistry?",
            "back": "They are similar to the building blocks of DNA, specifically nucleotides. These nucleotides consist of a nitrogen base, a sugar molecule called deoxyribose in DNA and a different sugar molecule called ribose in RNA, and a phosphate group."
        },
        {
            "front": "What are the basic components of a nucleotide in RNA?",
            "back": "A nucleotide consists of a ribose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and three phosphate groups."

        {
            "front": "What is the main difference between uracil and thymine?",
            "back": "Uracil is missing a methyl functional group that is found in thymine, making their structures similar but not identical. This distinction is crucial in understanding the roles these nucleobases play in DNA and RNA."
        },
        {
            "front": "What must proteins responsible for transcription be able to do first?",
            "back": "They must be able to recognize the beginning of the DNA element to be copied."
        },
        {
            "front": "What is a promoter in a DNA sequence?",
            "back": "A promoter is a specific DNA sequence where proteins bind and initiate transcription, allowing genetic information to be expressed. It serves as a regulatory site where the transcription process begins, allowing cells to control gene expression. This binding facilitates the creation of a RNA molecule from DNA."
        },
        {
            "front": "What does the specific sequence of a promoter determine in a gene?",
            "back": "The specific sequence of a promoter determines whether the corresponding coding portion of the gene is transcribed all the time, some of the time, or infrequently."

        {
            "front": "How do sequence variations affect gene expression?",
            "back": "Sequence variations can influence the strength of the transcriptional machinery binding to the promoter to initiate transcription. This can lead to changes in gene expression, resulting in different levels of mRNA produced by that gene."
