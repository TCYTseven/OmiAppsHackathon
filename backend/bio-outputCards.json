            "front": "What is the stopping point of the machine?",
            "back": "The machine should stop at a predetermined or designated point. This ensures safety, efficiency, and proper function."

        {
            "front": "What are the molecular similarities between RNA and DNA?",
            "back": "The building blocks of RNA are very similar to those of DNA, with both using nucleotide bases (such as adenine, guanine, cytosine, and uracil)."

        {
            "front": "What is a promoter in the context of DNA?",
            "back": "A promoter is a DNA sequence that allows proteins to initiate transcription by binding to it, starting the process. This sequence is essential for the expression of genes in a cell."
        },
        {
            "front": "What is the typical location of a promoter in relation to a gene?",
            "back": "The promoter exists upstream of the gene it regulates. This allows for the initiation of transcription by binding regulatory proteins."

        {
            "front": "What is the main role of the sequence of a promoter in a gene?",
            "back": "The sequence of a promoter determines the frequency of transcription, which can be all the time, some of the time, or infrequently of the corresponding coding portion of the gene."
        },
        {
            "front": "What are the areas near the initiation site where similar sequences are commonly found in promoters across various species?",
            "back": "These areas are located upstream and include -10 and -35 regions."
        },
        {
            "front": "What regulates the production of transcripts?",
            "back": "This mechanism helps control the number of transcripts made and their frequency of creation. It ensures transcripts are produced when needed and not excessively."

        {
            "front": "What is a notable feature of the -10 consensus sequence in bacterial cells?",
            "back": "The -10 consensus sequence is often AT rich, typically resembling the sequence TATAAT."

            "front": "What happens after a protein-DNA interaction is made in the transcription process?",
            "back": "After a protein-DNA interaction is made, the subunits of the core RNA polymerase bind to the site."
        },
        {
            "front": "What role does the AT-rich -10 region play in the process of DNA unwinding during transcription initiation?",
            "back": "The AT-rich -10 region facilitates the unwinding of the DNA template, making it easier for several phosphodiester bonds to be formed. This unwinding allows the transcriptional machinery to access the DNA template."
