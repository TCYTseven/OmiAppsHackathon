            "front": "What is the purpose of transcription in molecular biology?",
            "back": "Transcription creates an RNA copy of a segment of DNA, which is a crucial step in the process of gene expression. This process allows the genetic information from DNA to be transmitted and used for various cellular functions."

            "back": "A Design Challenge is a mindset used to approach a problem from a creative perspective, considering multiple factors and potential solutions to drive innovation and improvement. It requires thinking critically and exploring different design options to achieve a desired outcome."

        {
            "front": "What process do you think is needed to create an RNA copy from a single strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule?",
            "back": "During transcription, an enzyme (RNA polymerase) reads the DNA sequence and synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule by adding nucleotides to a growing RNA strand. This process is essential for creating the initial RNA copy of the single strand of DNA."
        },
        {
            "front": "What is the purpose of using Design Challenge thinking when developing a robot?",
            "back": "To identify problems and subproblems that need to be solved by the robot."

            "front": "What location should a DNA sequencing machine target for analysis?",
            "back": "The machine should be directed to the specific base pair location in a genome where the desired genetic information is stored."
        },
        {
            "front": "How do machines read start and stop site information?",
            "back": "Machines read start and stop site information through encoded data that allows them to understand the location and boundaries of the sites."

            "front": "What are the basic components of a nucleotide in RNA?",
            "back": "A nucleotide is composed of a ribose sugar, a nitrogenous base, and three phosphate groups."

        {
            "front": "What is the primary difference between the sugars found in DNA and RNA nucleotides?",
            "back": "The primary difference is that RNA contains ribose sugars, whereas DNA contains deoxyribose sugars."

        {
            "front": "What is a key structural difference between uracil and thymine in DNA/RNA?",
            "back": "Uracil is missing a methyl group compared to thymine. This structural difference affects their roles in DNA and RNA bases."
        },
        {
            "front": "What do transcription proteins need to do first to initiate transcription?",
            "back": "They need to recognize the beginning of the DNA sequence to be copied."

        {
            "front": "What is the role of a DNA sequence known as a promoter?",
            "back": "It refers to a DNA sequence onto which proteins bind to initiate transcription."
        },
        {
            "front": "What role does the sequence of a promoter play in gene expression?",
            "back": "The sequence of a promoter determines how often the corresponding coding portion of the gene is transcribed, affecting whether it is transcribed constantly, partially, or infrequently."
        },
        {
            "front": "What can be preserved among different species' promoters?",
            "back": "Conserved elements of similar sequence are sometimes preserved."
        },
        {
            "front": "What are the regions on a promoter that contain similar sequences across many promoters and species?",
            "back": "These regions, found upstream of the initiation site, are known as promoter consensus sequences."
        },
        {
            "front": "What does the variation in promoter sequences among similar organisms typically indicate?",
            "back": "It indicates that some promoters may have sequences very similar to the most common sequence elements, while others may have significantly different sequences. This variation is a common occurrence in the study of promoter sequences."

        {
            "front": "What effect do sequence variations have on transcription initiation?",
            "back": "Sequence variations can affect the strength to which the transcriptional machinery binds to the promoter, thereby influencing the initiation of transcription."
