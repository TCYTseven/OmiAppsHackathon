# OmiAppsHackathon

This app is a learning tool that transforms lesson notes into customized flashcards, by leveraging transcripts and AI to create interactive study aids. It converts audio content into text, and then utilizies AI to make impactful flashcards. Next, it publishes your flashcards with a unique code, making the flashcards accessible on both phones and laptops for efficient review.

## Inspiration 💡
As students, we understand the time consuming and ineffective methods that others use. Studying often requires a **complete memory of lessons** and the time for the **tedious process** of making flashcards, practice tests, etc. Automated Flashcards eliminates these needs using Omi.

## What it does 📚
Automated Flashcards uses the power of AI to **transform** your lessons and lectures into **easy to study** and impactful flashcards on a custom studying website.

## How we built it 💻
For the frontend, we used Next.js, MongoDB and Tailwind to create a **seamless UI** allowing the addition, modifications, sharing and studying of customized flashcards.

## Challenges we ran into 💪
As we built our studying frontend **from scratch**,  integrating with Omi was more challenging than just having a user login to an external service. We developed a process in which users set up accounts and sync their frontend with their account to access their personalized sets, and can add and share sets to others.

This makes our app **multifunctional**, being able to be used by teachers, to share study tools for their lessons to their students and students to study from their lesson themselves.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏆
We are proud of our creation of a **completely functional** app within a short amount of time. This has challenged us and led us to build a project that we are proud of.

## What we learned 🏫
We learned how to seamlessly **integrate** our development with **Omi**, and greatened our understanding and speed of frontend development. These are skills we will forever carry into our lives.

## What's next for Automated Flashcards 💥
We aim to further the development of Automated Flashcards by adding more **study methods**, bringing our app parallel with others, like Quizlet, and **enhancing** the generation of sets to be better tailored to the interests of the user.
